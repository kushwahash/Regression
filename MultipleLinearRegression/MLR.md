Similar to Linear Regression but has more covariance (Independent variables/feature)

Here the formula changes to 

Y = B0 + B1X1 + B2X2 ...... +BnXn

What is P-Value ?
The P value, or calculated probability, is the probability of finding the observed, or more extreme, results when the null hypothesis (H0) of a study question is true – the definition of ‘extreme’ depends on how the hypothesis is being tested. P is also described in terms of rejecting H0 when it is actually true, however, it is not a direct probability of this state.

Fast Facts
In a statistical hypothesis test, p-value is the level of marginal significance representing a given event's probability of occurrence.
To calculate p-values, you can use p-value tables or spreadsheet/statistical software.
A smaller p-value indicates that there is stronger evidence favoring the alternative hypothesis.
