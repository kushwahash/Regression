Similar to Linear Regression but has more covariance (Independent variables/feature)

Here the formula changes to 

Y = B0 + B1X1 + B2X2 ...... +BnXn

What is P-Value ?
The P value, or calculated probability, is the probability of finding the observed, or more extreme, results when the null hypothesis (H0) of a study question is true – the definition of ‘extreme’ depends on how the hypothesis is being tested. P is also described in terms of rejecting H0 when it is actually true, however, it is not a direct probability of this state.

Null hypothesis ->
In inferential statistics, the null hypothesis is a general statement or default position that there is no relationship between two measured phenomena, or no association among groups.[1] Testing (accepting, approving, rejecting, or disproving) the null hypothesis—and thus concluding that there are or are not grounds for believing that there is a relationship between two phenomena (e.g. that a potential treatment has a measurable effect)—is a central task in the modern practice of science; the field of statistics gives precise criteria for rejecting a null hypothesis.

The null hypothesis is generally assumed to be true until evidence indicates otherwise.

In statistics, it is often denoted H0; and, regardless of whether the expression is pronounced "H-nought", "H-null", or "H-zero" (or, even, by some, "H-oh"), the subscript is always written with the digit 0, never the upper-case letter of the alphabet O.

Fast Facts ->
In a statistical hypothesis test, p-value is the level of marginal significance representing a given event's probability of occurrence.
To calculate p-values, you can use p-value tables or spreadsheet/statistical software.
A smaller p-value indicates that there is stronger evidence favoring the alternative hypothesis.

significance level ->
The significance level, also denoted as alpha or α, is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. For example, a significance level of 0.05 indicates a 5% risk of concluding that a difference exists when there is no actual difference.

IMPORTANT -> 
   If the p-value is less than or equal to the alpha (p< .05), then we reject the null hypothesis, and we say the result is statistically significant.
    
   If the p-value is greater than alpha (p > .05), then we fail to reject the null hypothesis, and we say that the result is statistically nonsignificant (n.s.).
