Simple Linear Regression using Python.

#Will follow data processing and doing LR 

#What is SLR - 

it concerns two-dimensional sample points with one independent variable and one dependent variable (conventionally, the x and y coordinates in a Cartesian coordinate system) and finds a linear function (a non-vertical straight line) that, as accurately as possible, predicts the dependent variable values as a function of the independent variables

#Formula
y = mx + c

y - dependent variable
m - slope or coefficient (the change in x is not linear to y)
c - constant

#In our data case

Y - Salary, which we have to find
X - Age

We will try to find the best fitted line going across the input points. This will give us a equation which can be used to find Y provided the X value.

  C - where it is cutting the Y
  m - slope , means if it is more then the increase in slary with age is more. If it is less then increment in salary with age is not that much.

  #how we are going to find this line
  SLR will try to fit the sample data with different sets of line and will give the line where we have the minimum of least square distance.
