#Will follow data processing and doing LR 

#What is SLR - 

it concerns two-dimensional sample points with one independent variable and one dependent variable (conventionally, the x and y coordinates in a Cartesian coordinate system) and finds a linear function (a non-vertical straight line) that, as accurately as possible, predicts the dependent variable values as a function of the independent variables

#Formula
y = mx + c

y - dependent variable
m - slope or coefficient (the change in x is not linear to y)
c - constant

 #how we are going to find this line
  SLR will try to fit the sample data with different sets of line and will give the line where we have the minimum of least square distance.
