#In our data case

Y - Salary, which we have to find
X - Age
Y = mX + C

We will try to find the best fitted line going across the input points. This will give us a equation which can be used to find Y provided the X value.

  C - where it is cutting the Y
  m - slope , means if it is more then the increase in slary with age is more. If it is less then increment in salary with age is not that much.
